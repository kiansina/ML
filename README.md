# ML
Useful hints, ready_to_use plots, etc for machine learning

# 0) 1- fruit_data_with_colors.txt:

    This is a text file which is used in some of the example codes.

# 0) 2- mlplt:

    Ready to use excellent plots. (For different types of machine learning methods in supervised regression and classification)

# 1) ML_initial_plots:

   Here two plots are introduced for helping better understanding of a problem (as an example KNN_classification problem). 
   
   A) First plot, is a combined plot of histograms and distribuitions. It can ease finding correlations. 
   
   B) Second plot is just a 3D scatter plot that can help visualizing the problem in a better way when we have 3 features.
 
# 2) ML_KNNClassification: 

    Application of K_Nearest_Neighbors in classification including following subjects:
    
    A) Procedure of application of K_Nearest_Neighbors in classification
    
    B) Nice plot to show the accuracy of the algorithm. 
    
    C) Sensitivity test of accuracy on "K" depicting its plot
    
    D) Sensitivity test of accuracy on train/test split proportion depicting its plot.
    
    
# 3) ML_Synsethic_data:

    This is a sample code to create different types of synthetic data to test some machine learning methods or any other use. 4 main types that are mentioned here are:

    A) Synthetic dataset for simple regression
    
    B) Synthetic dataset for more complex regression
    
    C) Synthetic dataset for classification (binary)
    
    D) More difficult synthetic dataset for classification (binary) with classes that are not linearly separable

# 4) ML_Binary_Decision_boundary_plot:

    A) Sample code to depict accuracy of binary classification and its decision boundary

# 5) ML_KNNRegressor:

    Application of K_Nearest_Neighbors in regression including following subjects:

    B) plot k-NN regression on sample dataset for different values of K

# 6) ML_Linearregression:

    Application of Linear Regression including following subjects:
    
    A) Procedure of application of Least_Squares Regression 
    
    B) plot Least_Squares Regression on sample dataset
    
    C) Procedure of application of Ridge Regression
    
    D) Effect of scaling on Ridge
    
    E) Procedure of application of Lasso Regression
    
    F) Alpha effect on Lasso
