Useful hints, ready_to_use plots, etc for machine learning

1) ML_initial_plots:

   Here two plots are introduced for helping better understanding of a problem (as an example KNN_classification problem). 
   
   A) First plot, is a combined plot of histograms and distribuitions. It can ease finding correlations. 
   
   B) Second plot is just a 3D scatter plot that can help visualizing the problem in a better way when we have 3 features.
