Useful hints, ready_to_use plots, etc for machine learning

0) fruit_data_with_colors.txt:

    This is a text file which is used in some of the example codes.

0) mlplt:

    Ready to use excellent plots. (For different types of machine learning methods in supervised regression and classification)

1) ML_initial_plots:

   Here two plots are introduced for helping better understanding of a problem (as an example KNN_classification problem). 
   
   A) First plot, is a combined plot of histograms and distribuitions. It can ease finding correlations. 
   
   B) Second plot is just a 3D scatter plot that can help visualizing the problem in a better way when we have 3 features.
 
2) ML_KNNClassification: 

    Application of K_Nearest_Neighbors in classification including following subjects:
    
    A) Procedure of application of K_Nearest_Neighbors in classification
    
    B) Nice plot to show the accuracy of the algorithm. 
    
    C) Sensitivity test of accuracy on "K" depicting its plot
    
    D) Sensitivity test of accuracy on train/test split proportion depicting its plot.
